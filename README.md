# Health Monitoring System for the MST Structure
## Victor Barbosa Martins (DESY) for the MST-STR group of CTA
This Project aim to develop a system, which is able to deliver important information about the telescope structure. The analysis and the reports are generated automatically. The system should be able to detect changes in the structure such as variations in the rope tensions and other structure damages. The local team should receive a report when any change is detected and should act accordingly on it to avoid further damages to the telescopes.
